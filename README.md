[awesome-youtube](https://github.com/trvv/awesome-youtube) was born out of a frustration that I, and I believe many others, felt in that I often find myself unable to find new and interesting YouTube channels in the flows of sludge that seem to cover the majority of the site. I definetly know of channels that are awesome in their own regard, but I am able to find them only through insane luck or shoutouts from channels I already watch. This is *terrible* and I wanted a better way. Here it is (hopefully it matches your use case too...).

The only way that this can do what it needs to do is if those people that use it also contribute the channels that they know of and think are awesome to the list as well, to keep it fresh and populated with new contact to grow. However, **quantity** should never exceed **quality**, after all, the whole point of this is to index awesome channels. So, when requesting a new channel to be added, please provide some justification or maybe some of the highlighted videos of the channel to make it more obvious what makes this channel so awesome.

A side goal of this is to showcase that YouTube isn't *all* brainless gunk, and that there still is fantastic content all over the platform just waiting to be discovered.

Oh and one more note: this is **not** a place to spam your own channel. I know you may *think* your own channel is awesome but that may not reflect the opinions of everyone else. If your content really is awesome it will find its way here eventually.

Thanks for reading and stay awesome :D.
